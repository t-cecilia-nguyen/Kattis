Input
Input consists of up to 100 graphs. Each starts with an integer, 1 <= n <= 20, giving the number of vertices in the graph. 
Next come n lines with n integers on each line, which describe an n*n adjacency matrix for the graph. 
Vertices are numbered from 0 to n - 1. 
If the adjacency matrix contains a one at row r, column c (where 0 <= r, c <= n - 1), it means that there is an edge from vertex r to vertex c. 
Since the graph is undirected, the adjacency matrix is symmetric. The end of input is marked by a value of -1 for n.

Output
For each graph, produce a line listing the weak vertices ordered from least to greatest.
