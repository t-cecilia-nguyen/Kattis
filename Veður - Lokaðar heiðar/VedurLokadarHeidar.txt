Input
The first line of the input contains one integer v (0 <= v <= 200), the current wind speed over Iceland. 
The second line of the input contains one integer n (1 <= n <= 100), the number of roads.

The net n lines will each consist of a string s, the name of the road, and an integer k (0 <= k <= 200), which gives the maxiumum safe wind speed for that road, separated by a space.

Output
Print n lines, one for each road, which says whether it is safe to travel that road given the wind speed v. 
Each line should either be “opin” if it is safe to travel or “lokud” if it is not to safe to travel along the road.

Note that the order of the roads should be the same in the input and output.
