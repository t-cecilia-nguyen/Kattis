Input
The input consists of a single test case with two integer numbers X (0 <= X <= 1000) and Y (0 <= Y <= 1000) denoting the number of level junctions and switches, respectively. 
You may assume that Theta has sufficiently many straight and curved pieces as well as bridges.

Output
Output "possible" if she can build a closed track using all level junctions and all switches without any dead ends, or "impossible" otherwise.
