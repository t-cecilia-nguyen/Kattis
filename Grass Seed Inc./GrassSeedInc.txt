Input
One line containing a real number C (0 < C <= 100), the cost of seed to sow one square metre of lawn.
One line containing an integer L (0 < L <= 100), the number of lawns to sow.
L lines, each containing two positive real numbers: w (0 <= w <= 100), the width of the lawn, and l ( 0 <= l <= 100), the length of the lawn.
All real numbers are given with at most 8 decimals after the decimal point.

Output
One line containing a real number: the cost to sow all of the lawns.
All output must be accurate to an absolute or relative error of at most 10^-6.
