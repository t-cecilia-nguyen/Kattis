Input
The first line of input contains a single decimal integer P, (1 <= P <= 10000), which is the number of data sets that follow. 
Each data set should be processed identically and independently.

Each data set consists of a single line of input. It contains the data set number, K, followed by a single space, followed by a single decimal integer N, (1 <= N <= 10000), which gives the number of days to assume for the holiday. 
The data set number K starts at 1 and is incremented by 1 for each data set.

Output
For each data set there is one line of output. The single output line consists of the data set number, K, followed by a space followed by the number of candles needed for an N-day Chanukah holiday.
